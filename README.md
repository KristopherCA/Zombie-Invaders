# Zombie-Invaders
This game was a semester project for a college course at Florida GulfCoast University and is modeled after the classic game Space Invaders. It was written in conjuction with a fellow classmate (Jose Espinoza). The left and right arrow keys control the movement while spacebar shoots. All assets, including sprite icons and audio files are covered under then fair use clause of the copywright act.
